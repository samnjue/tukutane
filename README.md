The EventScreen fetches event data from a Supabase table and displays it in a scrollable list. Users can filter events by category using pill-shaped buttons and either RSVP (client-side toggle) or save events directly to their device’s native calendar. The screen enables quick discovery, easy interaction, and seamless integration with the user’s personal schedule.
